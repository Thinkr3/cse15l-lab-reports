            - grade.sh
            - ListExamples.java
            - TestListExamples.java
                
    - The contents of each file before fixing the bug
        - ![Image](img/before.png)
    - The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
        - `bash grade.sh ListExamples.java`
    - A description of what to edit to fix the bug
        - Go to `ListExamples.java`
        - Change line 14 to `List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();`
        - Change line 17 to `result.add(list.get(i));`
        - Delete line 20
