## Interesting Command Line Arguments for `less` üìö ##
Note to grader: I got a little to distracted and now have 2 of my own examples alongside the 2 actual required examples.

## Line Number `-N` Poetry üî¢ ##

- `-N` adds line numbers to each line so you can keep track of where you are in your file!
    - This can be very helpful for your impromptu poetry sessions on your remote server
        - `less -N hamlet.txt`
        ``` 
        1 To be, or not to be, that is the question:
        2 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        3 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        4 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        5 And by opposing end them. To die-to sleep,
        6 No more; and by a sleep to say we end
        7 The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
        8 That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
        9 Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
        10 To sleep, perchance to dream-ay, there's the rub:
        11 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
        12 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil...
        hamlet.txt (END)
        ```
    - You could also use this to debug code files. This allows you to find an error on a specific line number. 
        - `less -N Hello.java`
        ```
        1 class Hello {
        2         public static void main(String[] args) {
        3                 System.out.println("Hello")
        4         }
        5 }
        Hello.java (END)
        ```
        - No semicolon on line 3!!! **(‚ïØ‚Äµ‚ñ°‚Ä≤)‚ïØÔ∏µ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª**
    - This also works on *really* long files so you don't get lost reading them. üò¥
        - `less -N ./technical/911report/preface.txt`
        ```

        10 lawyers have reason to be proud of their collective "commitment to

## Search Pattern `/` Sleuthing üîé ##

- `/` can help you find occurences of words while you are "lessing" a document! (Using `-p<pattern>` also works!)
- Use `p` to look at previous occurences and `n` to look at the next occurence.
    - You can use this to find repeated words in text files!
        - `less hamlet.txt` then while in the less screen `/sleep`
        - <img src="img/high-hamlet.png" height="300" width="500">
        - I had to paste an image because highlights cannot appear on code blocks :/
    - You can also make your debuging life easier by finding specific errors.
        - `javac Hello.java 2> error.txt || less error.txt` then while in less `/error`
        - <img src="img/java-error.png" height="100" width="400">
        - Note: I used `||` because the first line exits with an error code, if this code succeeded I would've used `&&`. I would also change `2>` to `>`. Anyways, SEMICOLONS!!! **‚ï∞Ôºà‚Äµ‚ñ°‚Ä≤Ôºâ‚ïØ**
    - Use this to search *looong* documents for the important bits. üç¨
        - `less -pgene ./technical/biomed/rr37.txt`
        - <img src="img/gene-search.png" height="200" width="500">
        - `less ./technical/911report/chapter-1.txt` then `/flag`
        - <img src="img/flag-search.png" height="100" width="600">

## Real-time `+F` Chicanery ‚è± ##

- `+F` can help you see your file update in real-time!
    - This can be used to keep an up to date log file to measure changes in real time, git!
        - `less +F updates.txt` is empty until I start making changes
        ```
        Waiting for data... (interrupt to abort)
        ```

        - When I make my first few changes the less screen will update!
        
            ```
            Ver 0.1
            Added a hello world program!

            Ver 0.2
            Added a semicolon to make hello world actually run...
            Waiting for data... (interrupt to abort)
            ```

    - I use this one to check my stock options while programming on a terminal üòé
        - `less +F stocks.txt` will show
        ```
        Apple Inc. $173.60
        Microsoft. $312.31
        Amazon. $110.19
        Waiting for data... (interrupt to abort)
        ```
        - But if I buy stocks in Circuit City my stocks.txt will update automatically!
        ```
        Apple Inc. $173.60
        Microsoft. $312.31
        Amazon. $110.19
        Circuit City. $0.01
        Waiting for data... (interrupt to abort)
        ```
        - Note it may take a second line input for the first line input to be updated. Also note that this cannot edit previous lines.
    - This could allow you to add addendums to files and view their changes in real time! Now we can wait for 20+ old files to be updated üòé.
        - `less +F ./technical/government/Media/Philly_Lawyers.txt`
        
            ```
            ... # (Omitted 100 lines for brevity)
            commitment to those who need but cannot afford legal services. That
            is a commitment that we are duty-bound to honor and it is a
            commitment that we can and will uphold. The journey along this path
            begins today " he concluded.

            Waiting for data... (interrupt to abort)
            ```

        - `less +F ./technical/911report/preface.txt` if we wait long enough they might update this book...
        
            ```
                this process with strong opinions about what would work. All of us have had to
                        pause, reflect, and sometimes change our minds as we studied these problems and
                        considered the views of others. We hope our report will encourage our fellow
                        citizens to study, reflect-and act.

## Editing Files `v` Final Boss üòà ##

- Although less is read-only, pressing `v` while in less opens Vim.
- Press `s` while in Vim to start editting.
- To exit Vim use `Esc` + `:wq!` to save changes or `Esc` + `:qa!` to save without changes.
    - Now I can fix that pesky semicolon in my hello program on a remote computer
        - `less Hello.java` then press `v`
        ```
        class Hello {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello");
            }
        }
        Hello.java [dos] (20:37 10/05/2023)
        "Hello.java" [noeol][dos] 5L, 94B
        ```
        - Note: omitted `~` which are used to fill up the rest of the screen
        - Added the semicolon!!!
    - I can also update my stock portfolio with the proper values now
        - `less stocks.txt` then press `v`
        ```
        Apple Inc. $403.60
        Microsoft. $312.31
